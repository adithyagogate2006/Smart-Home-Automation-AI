## 🎯 Objective

Develop an AI-based simulation to automate home appliances like lights and fans using Python, based on inputs such as time, temperature, and human presence.

## 📝 Project Description

This project simulates a smart home automation system where appliances are controlled automatically using AI logic implemented in Python. The system considers factors like current time, room temperature, and human presence to decide whether to turn appliances ON or OFF.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Light Control**: Turns ON the lights if it's evening (after 6 PM) and someone is present at home.
- **Fan Control**: Turns ON the fan if the room temperature exceeds 30°C.

## 📊 Results

The simulation successfully demonstrates automated control of home appliances based on predefined conditions, showcasing the potential of AI in enhancing home convenience and energy efficiency.

## ✅ Conclusion

This project illustrates how AI can be applied to automate household appliances, leading to increased comfort and energy savings. Through this project, I learned how to implement conditional logic in Python and how to structure a project using Google Colab and GitHub.
